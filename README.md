**Sential** is a sleek, SwiftUI-based iOS application thoughtfully designed for individuals who find strict calorie tracking apps—where precise food weighing is required—challenging, especially those with difficult relationships with food. Built with modern Swift and SwiftData, this app offers a more lenient approach, allowing users to track only the macros they choose (calories, protein, fat, carbs) with customizable targets, fostering a healthier and less rigid tracking experience. Note that it requires users to have some knowledge of nutrition to use effectively.

## About the Project

Developed by [Remington Steele](https://github.com/remsteele) as a personal project, Sential showcases expertise in iOS development, data persistence, and user-centered design. Launched on June 13, 2025, this app is a testament to creating functional, user-friendly tools with a focus on health and wellness.

## Features

- **Flexible Goal Setting**: Customize fitness goals (Lose Weight, Gain Muscle, Maintain) and track only the macros you want with adjustable targets.
- **Lenient Calorie Tracking**: Log food intake without needing to weigh food, focusing on calories, protein, fat, or carbs as desired.
- **Progress Monitoring**: View daily progress with a clean, sortable timeline of meals and nutritional summaries.
- **AI Chat Assistant**: Interact with an AI to log food or get remaining calorie insights, persisting chats by day.
- **Responsive Design**: Intuitive navigation with date picker, arrows, and a settings panel, all built with SwiftUI.
